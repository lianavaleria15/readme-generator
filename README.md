## Description

The following application assists users in generating a readme file for their GitHub projects. The readme generator was built using Node.js and Inquirer.js. The user is prompted with a series of questions regarding the readme file content (e.g. installation, usage or testing steps, contact details, how can people contribute to their project). After all answers are typed, a message is printed on the terminal to inform the user the file was generated.
